Things that I’ve learned today! 

**Some things that I have known and reinforced:**


#subscripting

	•	print("Hello" [-1])

#string

	•	print ("123" + "345")

#integer = whole number

	•	print(123+234)
	
	•	print(123_456_789) #larger integers instead of commas we have underscore
   
#float = floting point number (decimals)

	•	print(3.14256)

#boolean, values always begin with capitals and no quotation.

	•	print(True)
 		print(False)

•	Mathematical Operations 

	o	#division (/) = result will always be a float
	
	o	#multiply (*)
	
	o	#subtract (-)
	
	o	#addition (+)
	
	o	#exponents (**)

**Some things that I don’t remember learning but have a background of:**

•	type() = to check what data type it is 

	o	float() = number with decimal places
	
	o	int() = integer
	
	o	str() = string 
	
	o	bool() = Boolean (btw Booleans will always have a capital –e.g. True or False)

•	type conversion 

	o	simply add the ^^data type functions listed above this then () 
	
		e.g. (“123”) = string, but int(“123”) = integer 

•	tip: can not concatenate a string to an int/float 

•	tip: type conversion from string to int, sometimes you can't convert to different data types tho it turns it into a valueError 

	o	e.g. "ABC" to int is not possible since "ABC" are not actual numbers

**Completely new to me: **

•	Mathematical Operations 

	o	#floor division = removes the float, but will only round down to the nearest lowest number (was how I interpreted) 
		
			E.g. -5/2 = -2.5 but -5//2= -3 

•	Round() = rounding the numbers

	o	round(x,n), n being the number of decimal places you want rounded to. 

•	Assignment operators

	o	+=
	
	o	-=
	
	o	*=
	
	o	/=

> score = 0
> 
> height = 1.8
>
> is_winning = True #user scores a point
>
> score += 1 #instead of score = score + 1

•	F-strings = can combine strings and variables together 

	o	f(“your score is: {score}”) 
	
	o	things needed for f-strings: “” and {}
